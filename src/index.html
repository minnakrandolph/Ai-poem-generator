        Lord,
        when you send the rain
        think about it, please,
        a little?
        <br />
Do
        not get carried away
        by the sound of falling water,
        the marvelous light
        on the falling water.
        <br />
    I
        am beneath that water.
        It falls with great force
        and the light
        <br />
Blinds
        me to the light.
        <br />
